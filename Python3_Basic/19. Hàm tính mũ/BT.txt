Task
Given two integers a and b entered through the keyboard. Write a Python program to calculate the value of a to the power of b (a^b) and print the result on the screen.

Example:
	+) For a = 3, b = 4, the output should be 81
		Because 3^4 = 81
	+) For a = 5, b = 2, the output should be 25
		Because 5^2 = 25

Input: a, b are integer coming from the keyboards

Output: The result displays on the screen as required
	Execution time limit: 1s

Suggestion
	Write a function to take the value of a and b and use recursive method to calculate the value of a^b.
