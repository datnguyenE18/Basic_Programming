Input two integers x and y from keyboard. Write a Python program to check whether x is greater then y or not. Print True if x is greater than y. Otherwise, print False.

Example:
For x = 10, y = 5, the output should be x > y: True
For x = 2, y = 8, the output should be x > y: False

Input: x, y are integers entered through keyboard

Output: Print True or False on the screen.
